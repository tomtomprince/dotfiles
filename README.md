## Install the basics

I chose to use rcm defaults and try to run everything from the home directory as much as possible

```
sh ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```

This does the following:

1. Install Homebrew TODO: Handle linux and if already installed
2. Install rcm TODO: Handle if already installed
3. sync dots to home dir using rcup -d ~/.dotfiles TODO: See if doing this respects the excludes in rcrc without setting RCRC env
4. Should install zsh and company?

Also, this .zshrc is garbage...

TODO: Maybe install xcode and update to latest if on mac?
